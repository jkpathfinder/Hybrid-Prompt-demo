Please use the {selected} method for the template code to generate code that can escape mainstream antivirus engines, here are some examples:
'''

temp_file_prompt = '''
Here is the template code:
'''

# n=1 cot_prompt
simple_cot_prompt = '''
Let's think step by step. Make a plan then generate code. You should output strictly in the following format:

Code:

```
Plan 1:
Your code here.
```
```
Plan 2:
Your code here.
```
...
Note that your output is the code corresponding to {n} Plans. In addition to the formatted output specified above, please do not output additional explanatory statements.
'''

# n not equal to 1cot_prompt
cot_prompt = '''
Let's think step by step. Make a plan then generate code. You should output strictly in the following format:

Code:
```
Plan:
Your code here.
```

Description:
Your short description of the method used to generate the code.

Note that your output is only the code and the description corresponding to one plan. In addition to the formatted output specified above, please do not output additional explanatory statements.

vote_prompt = '''
Based on the several code candidates generated above, consider which one is the most promising. 
You need to consider the obfuscation and steganography of a Plan, as well as the differences between it and the previously provided Examples, and prioritize the Plans that are highly obfuscated and have fewer differences from the Examples.
Please analyze each Plan in detail. You should output strictly in the following format:

```
The best Plan is XX".
```
 
Where "XX" is the number of the plan you think is optimal. In addition to the formatted output specified above, please do not output additional explanatory statements.
